# DataAnalysisProjects_NywtkBootcamp

## About NYWTK
NYWTK is a youth technology initiative that runs immersive hands-on learning experiences to bridge the skills gap and empower young professionals for the job market. 

This repository contains the projects completed during the **100-day NYWTK Data Camp**. The camp is split into three phases that progressively build data skills and tooling:


| Month | Focus | Tools & Concepts |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Month 1** | **Python** | Data analysis, and visualization with `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` |
| **Month 2** | **Excel & Power BI** | Data cleaning, visualization, dashboards |
| **Month 3** | **SQL** | Querying relational databases, filtering, joining, aggregation |

All projects were collaborative group efforts, simulating real world analytics workflows that emphasized teamwork, effective communication, and data-driven decision making.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Python Project *Digital Behavior and Mental Health*

This project investigates the relationship between **digital behavioral patterns** (e.g., daily screen time, app-switching frequency, notifications) and **mental health indicators** (e.g., sleep hours, anxiety level , mood score).  

The goal was to explore how digital engagement impacts emotional well being, focus, and social balance.

**Key Skills & Tools**
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

###  2. Excel & Power BI Project *Store Sales Analysis in Saudi Arabia*

This analysis focuses on retail sales transactions from stores across **Saudi Arabia**.  
Each record represents a single sale, capturing customer demographics, product details, sales channels, and satisfaction ratings.  
The objective was to uncover **sales trends**, **customer insights**, and **performance patterns** through data visualization and dashboards.

**Key Skills & Tools**
- Data cleaning and organization 
- Pivot Tables
- Power Query
- Power BI dashboards

###  3. SQL Project *Crime Data Analysis in Cambridge*

Unlike a typical technical report, this project was presented as a story  a narrative that guided the audience through the journey of uncovering crime patterns in Cambridge.

By stepping into the role of data detectives, the team explored real crime datasets to reveal insights into when, where, and what types of crimes occurred most frequently. The story unfolded through SQL queries that progressively pieced together the full picture of crime dynamics across the city.

**Key Skills & Tools**
- SQL querying and aggregation
- Filtering, joining
