## About NYWTK
NYWTK is a youth technology initiative that runs immersive hands-on learning experiences to bridge the skills gap and empower young professionals for the job market. This repository contains the projects completed during the **100-day NYWTK Data Camp**. The camp is split into phases that progressively build data skills and tooling:


| Month | Focus | Tools & Concepts |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Month 1** | **Python** | Data analysis, and visualization with `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` |
| **Month 2** | **Excel & Power BI** | Data cleaning, visualization, dashboards |
| **Month 3** | **SQL** | Querying relational databases, filtering, joining, aggregation |

All projects were **collaborative group efforts** , simulating real-world analytics workflows, communication, and data-driven decision-making.teamwork.
